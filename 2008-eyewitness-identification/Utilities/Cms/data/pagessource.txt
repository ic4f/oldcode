// Ranking is based on how pages appear in this list. It matters only for pages which are in the menu.
// Indenting is optional.
// If a page is not in the menu, its parent MUST be in the menu, or else the system won't know 
//		what menu to display. Besides, if a page is not in the menu, most likely it's content
//		depends on user selections on the previous/parent page -> so displaying it in the 
//		context menu would be a headache.
// Permissions are a csv list of ids. If the list is empty, no permissions are required (like the home page)
// Permissions must correspond to permission ids in the permission source file.
// At least 1 matching perm in the user cookie is suffecient for the page/menu option to be displayed.
// Add pages ONE LINE AT A TIME - or else it may get messy.

//last used id  = 53

//id -- parentId -- menu title -- title -- url -- required permissions (any in the list)

// default.aspx MUST be id = 1
