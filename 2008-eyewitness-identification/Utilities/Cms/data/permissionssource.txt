//This list includes all permissions to the CMS, organized by categories, each with a unique id.
//id and parentId can be digits or digits preceeded with a "c" - which indicates a category
//There must be 3 levels for each permission: cat > subcat > permission. Therefore, a parent of a category must be a first-level category,
//		and a parent of permission must be a second-level category.
//Only cats and subcats can be parents.
//c-1 marks "no parent" 
//and/or is displayed for permissions only.
//"and" means that the permission can be added to others - i.e., displayed as a checkbox.
//"or" means that only one of the permissions in this subcat can be selected - i.e., radios for each or + "none"
//ids do not have to be sequential.
//the code is the name of the public static int field in CmsCore.PermissionCode. Create those fields before processing this file.

//current last used cat Id = 9
//current last used perm Id = 6

//id -- parentid -- and/or -- name -- code
